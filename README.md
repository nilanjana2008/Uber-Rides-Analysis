   - **Track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs).
   - **Identify peak booking times and popular pickup/drop-off zones.
   - **Create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Power Query


### 2. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 3. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into  database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in both MySQL  using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.

### 4. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
